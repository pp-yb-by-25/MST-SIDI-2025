Nowsdays, the people  have been finally connected all around the world 
but unfortunally the different langages of each country make it difficult de communicate more effectively 
and even if someone tries to learn another langage, that's demand a lot of time, money and effort...
Thanks to technology especially AI, who integrated a lot of tools for dubbing in realtime,
the human is no longer in need of learning a langage to communicate, it s the time for creation , 
serious discussions about the real world problem , and how we will overcome them together.
Yeah the langage is just a tool to communicate the ideas and knowledge, and the AI tools assisstants make it easier.
